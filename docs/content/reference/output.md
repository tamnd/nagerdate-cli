Every list command in the fleet renders through one formatter, so the same flags
work everywhere. Wire your commands through it as you add them, and this page
describes what users get. Pick a format with `-o`, or let nagerdate choose:
a table when writing to a terminal, JSONL when piped.

## Formats

```bash
nagerdate <command> -o table     # a rounded, color-aware grid for reading
nagerdate <command> -o markdown  # a GitHub pipe table to paste into docs (alias: md)
nagerdate <command> -o jsonl     # one JSON object per line, for piping
nagerdate <command> -o json      # a single JSON array
nagerdate <command> -o csv       # spreadsheet friendly
nagerdate <command> -o tsv       # tab-separated
nagerdate <command> -o url       # just the URL column
nagerdate <command> -o raw       # the underlying bytes, unformatted
```

| Format | Best for |
|---|---|
| `table` | Reading on a terminal: a rounded border with an accented header |
| `markdown` | Pasting into a README, issue, or PR (alias `md`) |
| `jsonl` | Piping into another tool, one object at a time |
| `json` | Loading a whole result as an array |
| `csv` / `tsv` | Spreadsheets and quick column math |
| `url` | Feeding URLs into other commands |
| `raw` | The unformatted bytes (response bodies, file contents) |

## Color

On an interactive terminal the `table` and `json`/`jsonl` formats are colored:
the table draws a dim border with an accented header, and JSON keys, strings,
numbers, and literals are highlighted. Color is suppressed the moment output is
not a terminal, so a pipe always gets plain, parseable bytes. Force the choice
with `--color always|never` (or set `NO_COLOR`). `markdown`, `csv`, `tsv`,
`url`, and `raw` are never colored, so they stay safe to redirect into a file.

## Narrowing columns

Keep only the fields you want:

```bash
nagerdate <command> --fields id,title,url
```

`--no-header` drops the header row in `table` and `csv` output, which helps when
a downstream tool expects bare rows.

## Templating rows

For full control over each line, apply a Go text/template. Fields are the JSON
keys, capitalised:

```bash
nagerdate <command> --template '{{.URL}} {{.Title}}'
```

## Why auto-detection helps

Because the default adapts to the destination, the same command reads well by
hand and parses cleanly in a pipe:

```bash
nagerdate <command>            # a table, because this is a terminal
nagerdate <command> | wc -l    # JSONL, because this is a pipe
```

You only reach for `-o` when you want something other than that default.
